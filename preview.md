Please visit the link above to actually visit the website in development. As you visit my site, you will be able to see the very elaborate header, an old computer monitor, and various floppy disks floating across the screen. Of course, the idea of this website right now is just to be a simulation of what I would actually like to display. When one of the floppy disks is clicked, it will theoretically turn on the monitor below and display a real time chart for that Ticker. The "top movers" should update on the fly to which stocks have actually been moving the most, but in order to get both the top movers and a real time display of that ticker I think that I would actually need to start my own API server or something, which I am not entirely comfortable doing at my current level of understanding. I hope you can see the potential of what I want the actual website to look like. I still want to add a couple more features that would act as like a twitter between "bears" and "bulls" in the market. These elements will still all be part of the simulation. Hopefully one day I will actually be able to display real data!
